# This comes from Sean Kross' How to Start a Bookdown Book (http://seankross.com/2016/11/17/How-to-Start-a-Bookdown-Book.html).
# Essentially, it's a GitHub repository with generic files for starting a Bookdown Book.
# I've modified them for myself.

# This is the default rmd_files:. But I want one file in the root and the rest in chapters.
# rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", "01-Introduction.Rmd", "02-Diving-In.Rmd"]
# These two should work, but they don't work correctly yet.
# Add to the following as shown two lines above.
rmd_files: ["index.Rmd"]
# If the following line is active, then the book's components are in ./chapters"
rmd_subdir: ["chapters]
# I don't know what this does.
